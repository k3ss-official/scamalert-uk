## 🚀 Quick Start

### Smart Way (Recommended - AI Vibe Coder Style!)

```bash
# One command setup - handles everything!
make install
```

### Professional Make Commands

```bash
make install    # Smart automated setup (recommended)
make dev        # Start development server  
make test       # Run test suite
make deploy     # Deploy to production
make clean      # Clean up build files
```

### Old School Way (If you insist... 🙄)

```bash
# Manual installation for the traditionalists
make oldschool

# Or even more manual:
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Then manually set up conda env, .env file, API keys, etc.
# (But seriously, just use 'make install' above 😉)
```
